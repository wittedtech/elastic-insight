# elastic-insight
Spring Boot application that monitors and analyzes real-time application logs using the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats). The application will provide detailed insights into the application performance, error rates, and user activities. It will also feature advanced search capabilities and real-time alerting.


## Unique Features:

- Custom Log Analysis: The application will parse custom log formats and
provide rich visualizations and insights on application performance,
including the ability to drill down into specific log entries.

- Real-Time Anomaly Detection: Implement machine learning-based anomaly
detection using Elastic's machine learning capabilities to identify
unusual patterns in log data.

- User Behavior Analytics: Track and analyze user behavior on the
application, with a focus on security (e.g., detecting suspicious
activities) and usage patterns.
